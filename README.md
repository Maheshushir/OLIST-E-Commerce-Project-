#Olist E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

Overview
Welcome to the Olist E-Commerce Data Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze the e-commerce operations of Olist using four powerful tools: Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. By following a structured approach, we cleaned the raw data, derived key performance indicators (KPIs), and created dynamic visualizations to provide comprehensive insights into the business.

Project Workflow
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

The initial step involved cleaning the dataset using Excel. We handled missing values, eliminated duplicates, and standardized data formats to ensure accuracy and consistency for further analysis.
KPI Calculation and SQL Analysis:

After preparing the data, we identified and calculated five key performance indicators (KPIs) that are crucial for assessing the e-commerce business performance. These KPIs include:
Weekday vs Weekend Payment Statistics: Analyzing payment behaviors based on the timing of order purchases.
Number of Orders with Review Score 5 and Payment Type as Credit Card: Identifying high customer satisfaction linked to credit card transactions.
Average Number of Days Taken for Order Delivery (Pet Shop Category): Measuring efficiency in product delivery specific to the pet shop category.
Average Price and Payment Values from Customers of São Paulo City: Evaluating the spending patterns and payment behaviors of customers located in São Paulo.
Relationship Between Shipping Days and Review Scores: Investigating how shipping duration impacts customer satisfaction ratings.
Data Visualization:

Power BI:
Using Power BI, we created interactive dashboards to visualize the KPIs and trends. This facilitated an understanding of sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency within Olist.
Tableau:
In Tableau, we further enhanced our visual representation of the data. The visualizations displayed key insights such as sales distribution, category performance, and demographic analysis, allowing for more impactful storytelling through data.
